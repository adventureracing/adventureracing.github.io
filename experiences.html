            <h1>My Experiences</h1>
            <p>I have competed in a multitude of adventure races since joining the sport a couple of years ago. Below are a couple of these experiences just to give you a taste of what the sport has to offer.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>North Island Hillary Challenge Qualifier 2017 (6hrs)</h2>
            <p>This was my first ever adventure race. It was held in Rotorua, where over 20 teams competed and we managed to place second, earning ourselves a place in the 2018 Hillary Challenge Final. The race consisted of three stages. First was the orienteering sprint, where we had to collect a series of compulsory checkpoints in the fastest time possible. Next was the biking stage, which was 25km into the redwoods and up to the blue lakes collecting checkpoints along the way. We were 3rd for these two stages. The last stage of the race was the rogaine where we had the remainder of our time to collect as many checkpoints as we possibly could and compete in ‘mystery activities’ along the way.</p>

           <h2>ARC Race 2018 (12hrs)</h2>
           <p>This was my longest ever adventure race. It was held in Pauanui and consisted of three stages. First was the raft making and river crossing, where we had an hour to design and construct a raft using the given materials. We then had to cross the estuary to collect a checkpoint on the other side, before crossing back. Next was the trekking/orienteering stage. We set off on a trek up Mt Pauanui, collecting a multitude of checkpoints along the way. Next we embarked on the bike stage where we firstly had to cross ourselves, our bike, and our packs across a small section of the estuary, using tubes. Then we continued biking, collecting a series of compulsory checkpoints and partaking in rifle shooting and abseiling down a 45m face.</p>
