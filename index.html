            <p>Adventure Racing is a multisport that is made up of many disciplines i.e. running, biking, kayaking, rock climbing, abseiling, and problem solving. It is a truly inspirational sport, which ties together teamwork, an appreciation of nature, and just having fun! It teaches you not only practical skills for the outdoors but skills that can be applied throughout every aspect of life. This is why it is so important for younger generations to utilise the sport and gain such appropriate skills to be able to become the leaders of tomorrow. Adventure Racing is not just a physical sport but also a mental sport, in which you must constantly push your own limits.</p>
